The task was to build a ToDo List Website.

I made a simple website, where you can create tasks with a title, description, due date and a priority.
All tasks will be saved in a database.
Completed tasks will be shwon in an extra template.
The user can add, edit and delete tasks and set them to "completed" or "incompleted". There is also a filter function to arrange the tasks by priority, due date or alphabetical by title.

The frontend is completly made via bootstrap and with a little custom css.
